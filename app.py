# app.py

from main import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

The original code is already well-structured and follows the recommended PEP 8 guidelines. It is a simple script that imports the `main` function from the `main` module and calls it.

Since there are no specific instructions on what the `main` function does or what improvements can be made, we cannot refactor the code further or make any changes.
